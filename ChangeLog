	Fix issue #5.
	Berghel's & Roach's implementation assumes that the source string
	is shorter than or equal to the target in length. This patch will
	enforce this, both by:

	    - asserting this condition in `berghel_roach()`, and
	    - changing `read_corpus` to always sort the two strings
	      by length before returning them

	Fix issue #2.
	Change the conditional in function `f` in the implementation of
	Berghel & Roach to be sure that any idexes into the strings are
	legit.

	Clean-up-- remove the use of std::vector & variable-length arrays. Do the two-dimensional indexing manually.
